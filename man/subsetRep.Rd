}

\item{graph}{ADMG}

\item{max_size}{largest set to consider}

\description{
Get the subset representation of an ordinary ADMG
}
\details{
This returns sets of the form \code{HuA}, where \code{A} is any 
subset of \code{tail(H)}.  This representation is shown to 
correspond precisely to ordinary Markov equivalence.

\title{List Intrinsic Sets of Summary Graph or ADMG}
\usage{
intrinsicSets(graph, r = TRUE, by_district = FALSE, sort = 2, recall = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{object of class \code{mixedgraph}, must be an ADMG.}

\item{r}{logical, should recursive head definition be used? Defaults to \code{TRUE}}

\item{by_district}{logical, should intrinsic sets be grouped by district? Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{sort}{should output be sorted/unique?}

\item{recall}{logical: is this a recalling of the function (internal use only)}
}
\description{
List Intrinsic Sets of a Summary Graph or Acyclic Directed Mixed Graph, possibly by district.
}
\details{
\code{intrinsicSets} returns a list of integer vectors, 
each being an intrinsic set (or if \code{by_district = TRUE} 
a list of lists, each containing the intrinsic sets in a single 
district). If \code{r = FALSE} the intrinsic sets are the heads 
and their dis-tails.

\code{intrinsicClosure} returns an integer vector containing the closure of set.
